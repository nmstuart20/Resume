# Resume
My current resume written in LaTeX.

If you want to use this as a starting point for your own resume:

#### 1. Clone the Repo (from the command line)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nmstuart20/Resume.git
```

#### 2. Edit the resume.tex file (in any text editor or IDE of your choice)

#### 3. Create PDF from Terminal (from the command line) with the following command:
```sh
pdflatex resume_sw.tex
```
Or
```sh
latexmk -pdf resume_sw.tex
```
